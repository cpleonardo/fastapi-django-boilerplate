### FastAPI Django-ORM Boilerplate
A basic boilerplate for creating a project that leverages the speed and simplicity of FastAPI for building APIs and the powerful Django ORM for managing database interactions. This configuration allows developers to benefit from FastAPIâ€™s asynchronous capabilities for handling high-performance requests while taking advantage of Django's mature ORM and admin interface for database and content management, creating a well-rounded, efficient development environment.

## Features
- FastAPI for building APIs quickly and efficiently.
- Django ORM for database interactions.
- Django Admin.
- Full support to asynchronous requests with FastAPI.
